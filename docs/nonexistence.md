## Non-Existence And Non-Existence NPF Condition
Non-Existence is one of two conditions you might be in.

The basic idea is:<br>
For all intents and purposes, you do not exist in the activity/organization.

# Non-Existence NPF
Non-Existence New-Post-Formula (NPF) is a condition in which you have just
gotten a job and nobody knows you are the (insert post-title here) or they've
heard you are but act like you are not.

For example, you are the newly appointed person in charge of talking to
clients. The others in the organization may have heard of this but still go
on having meetings with their clients on their own even though it's YOUR
job now.

In other words, you, for all intents and purposes,
don't exist as far as they are concerned.

# Non-Existence
This is a slightly worse condition due to its implications.

This condition occurs when you were known (to some degree) as the person 
in charge of some certain thing or did some certain thing. But, due to failure
to produce or get the job done or some such reason, others no longer come to
you to get the job done or never even think of you when looking for
who can do it.

In other words, again, as far as the organization/field/activity is concerned,
you do not exist anymore. You have faded from their thoughts.
